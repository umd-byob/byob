Bacterial Transcriptomics
=========================

An overview of handling of data received from sequencing facilities, from quality control and trimming to alignment of reads and parsing of alignments into data files for analysis.

The presentation as it was given at the first meeting is available on the [Prezi website](http://prezi.com/mtiw5z9i0gfu/copy-of-analysis-of-bacterial-transcriptome-data/).

I may update this presentation in the future with more or newer information. This will also be [available](http://prezi.com/mtiw5z9i0gfu/copy-of-analysis-of-bacterial-transcriptome-data/).
