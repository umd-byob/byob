De Novo Transcriptome Assembly
==============================
This presentation will include a live demo of both the Trinity and Oases _de novo_ RNA-Seq assemblers, which are arguably, currently the two most popular _de novo_ RNA-Seq assemblers at the moment.  The presentation will also include a chalk talk comparing the theory underlying the approaches taken by each assembler.  Discussion will then turn towards practical considerations, as well as any other issues brought up during the presentation.  If time permits, there may also be very brief demonstrations of potential "next steps" to take with newly assembly mRNA contigs.

There will not be a formal presentation with slides, so none will be posted.  The commands I intend to use can be found in the [Presentation](https://github.com/trgibbons/byob/blob/master/presentations/2013/0910-de_novo_transcriptome_assembly/Presentation.md) markdown document.
